This code implements the coherent energy calculation by the modified phase coherence (Huang and Hawthorne, 2025; Hawthorne and Ampuero, 2018). This method can detect a target event by a template event and determine the target event's moment-rate power (relative to the template event) as well. 

To try the example code and data, go to the /code folder and run 'coherence_energy_func.py', which will give a result of coherent-energy series before a M 2.57 event in San Jacinto fault zone.
